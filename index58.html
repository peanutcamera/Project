        <p>My hobby is to read books! I think reading books is really fun and intrestings. I read books anytime I'm free or bored. Reading books apparently increases your vocabulary and imagination. The book series I am currently reading is The Trials of Apollo, it's a continuation series of Heroes of Olympus and Percy Jackson and the Olympians. The author of these series is Rick Riordan. The Trials of Apollo is about Greek Mythology.  </p>
